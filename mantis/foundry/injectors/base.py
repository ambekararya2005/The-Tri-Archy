"""Injector framework — the machinery that makes the atlas *executable*.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Pillar 1 (the 42-card atlas) is only worth a diversity score if it is a
dependency of Pillar 2 rather than a slide deck sitting next to it. That is
enforced here, at import time, by :func:`validate_registry`:

* every atlas card with ``status: implemented`` **must** have a registered
  injector class, and
* every registered injector's ``card_id`` **must** name a real card whose status
  is ``implemented``, and
* the card's declared ``generator`` path **must** resolve to a callable living in
  the injector's own module.

Fail any of those and ``import mantis.foundry.injectors`` raises. There is no
way to claim a card is implemented without the code existing, and no way to
write an injector for a card that does not exist. That is the whole point.

What an injector returns
------------------------
``inject()`` returns **only the new, labelled attack rows**, with exactly the
frozen ``ALL_COLUMNS`` schema. It never mutates the background frame, and never
relabels an existing row. Three reasons, all of which we have to be able to
defend:

1. The Day 1 calibration (amount KS 0.0051, hour TV 0.0066) was measured on the
   background. If injectors edited it in place, every fidelity number would
   silently drift as attacks were added, and the scorecard would be measuring
   the attacks rather than the simulation.
2. Per-attack accounting — counts, per-family recall, the zero-day holdout —
   needs the attack rows to be separable by construction, not by a join.
3. Injectors compose. Eight injectors run against one untouched background and
   the results concatenate, so a run is reproducible attack-by-attack.

How attack rows are built, and why it matters for realism
---------------------------------------------------------
Attack events are **clones of real background rows**, retargeted. An injector
picks source rows belonging to the customers it wants to use, copies them, and
then overrides merchant, amount and timestamp. Everything it does not override —
card BIN, device id, IP, geo, entry mode, 3DS outcome, the shape of the agentic
block — stays exactly as the legitimate population drew it.

This is not a shortcut, it is the realism mechanism. Fraud that only ever
touches freshly-minted entities is trivially detectable: a model learns
"never-before-seen device" and scores 0.99 without understanding anything. Real
card fraud rides on real cardholders' real credentials. Cloning guarantees that
every attack row belongs to a customer who already exists, on a device that
already exists, with a nullity pattern (no ``device_id`` on card-present, missing
geo on a share of remote rails) that already matches the population.

Amounts follow the same principle: :meth:`PopulationView.draw_amounts` resamples
*actual* background amounts from the target MCC inside a quantile band, so the
marginal amount distribution of an attack is, by construction, a slice of the
legitimate one rather than a fresh log-normal with attacker-chosen parameters.

Safety posture
--------------
Per CLAUDE.md HARD RULE 5 these injectors emit **tabular authorisation records
only** — amounts, categories, merchants, timings. Nothing here is operational
tooling: there is no payload, no target, no working technique. The output exists
to be caught by ``mantis.defense``.
