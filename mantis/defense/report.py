"""Rendering RESULTS.md.

RESULTS.md is written by code, not by hand, for one reason: a number that appears
in a document and nowhere in a run is a number nobody checked. Every figure below
comes out of :func:`~mantis.defense.experiment.run_experiment`, so re-running the
firewall rewrites the document, and a claim cannot outlive the measurement that
produced it.

The one thing this module is allowed to do that the experiment is not is
**editorialise** — the prose around each table says what the table means, what it
does not, and where it is weak. That prose is checked against the numbers it sits
next to on every run, because it is generated from them.
