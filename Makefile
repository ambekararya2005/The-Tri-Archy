# Day 1: the calibrated legitimate population. No network, no Kaggle token.
population:
	$(PY) -m mantis.foundry.base --n 200000 --seed 7

figure:
	$(PY) -m mantis.foundry.base.calibration

# Day 2: the labelled dataset. Prints class balance, per-attack counts and the
# best-single-feature AUC table, then writes the parquet and a manifest.
dataset:
	$(PY) -m mantis.foundry --attacks all --out data/generated/dataset_v1.parquet --show-content

# The subtlety gate on its own, against a small background. Fast enough to run
# after touching an injector.
probe:
	$(PY) -m mantis.foundry.injectors.probe

# Day 3: the text the agents read. Cache-first, so this runs identically with no
# Ollama, no GPU and no network -- see CLAUDE.md HARD RULE 3. Add --live --refresh
# to re-author it against a local model.
corpus:
	$(PY) -m mantis.foundry.llm --show

# Day 4: the Mandate Firewall.

# The feature layer, with the three-tier leakage assertion fired deliberately so
# a reader can watch it reject a label.
features:
	$(PY) -m mantis.defense.features

# L0's per-clause precision and FP rate, then the Day 3 HARD/CLEAN contract
# checked against a real L0 for the first time.
l0:
	$(PY) -m mantis.defense.l0_rules

# THE Day 4 deliverable. Pools five seeds, fits L1 and L2, runs
# leave-one-family-out, and writes RESULTS.md. ~10 minutes from a cold pool.
firewall:
	$(PY) -m mantis.defense

# Re-render RESULTS.md from the cached experiment, without refitting anything.
# For editing the document's prose without a fifteen-minute round trip.
render:
	$(PY) -m mantis.defense --render-only

# Day 5: the closed loop. Writes data/generated/arena.json -- the evasion curve
# and the zero-day comparison -- and any surviving variant back into
# mantis/atlas/discovered/. Re-run `make firewall` afterwards to fold its numbers
# into RESULTS.md. ~35 minutes; add `--cards all` for the whole atlas and hours.
loop:
	$(PY) -m mantis.loop --generations 5 --population 5 --seeds 2 --family F1

# A short arena with no zero-day run, for when you have touched a gene.
arena:
	$(PY) -m mantis.loop --generations 3 --population 4 --no-zero-day --no-writeback

# Day 5 QA: the single-feature probe cannot see a feature that is two columns and
# a regression, which is how mnd_deliberation_residual_z reached 0.99 on F1-01
# unnoticed. This runs the same gate over the matrix L1 actually trains on.
derived:
	$(PY) scripts/probe_derived.py

# Day 4 carry-overs: distribution drift, and the probe-slice audit.
drift:
	$(PY) scripts/drift_check.py

slices:
	$(PY) scripts/audit_probe_slices.py

# Gate: the schema imports, the atlas validates and agrees with the injector
# registry, the population generates, the labelled dataset generates.
