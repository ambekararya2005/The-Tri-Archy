"""Contract tests for the 42-card attack atlas.

The atlas is scored on **diversity of attacks** (judging criterion 1), and the
fastest way to lose that criterion is to be caught overclaiming. So the counts
are asserted, not assumed:

* 42 cards, split 12/6/8/6/5/5 across F1-F6.
* Exactly 8 carry a working injector. That number goes in the writeup verbatim,
  and it is a **ratchet**: it moves only when an injector actually lands.
* Implemented cards span at least four families, so the coverage claim is
  genuinely broad rather than four variations of one attack.
* A card is ``implemented`` **only** if it names a generator, and a ``mapped``
  card names none. A mapped card carrying a generator path implies an injector
  that does not exist, which is exactly the overclaim these tests exist to stop.

Note on the count. Day 1 marked 15 cards ``implemented`` on the strength of a
planned generator path. Day 2 made the atlas executable — importing
``mantis.foundry.injectors`` now *fails* unless every implemented card has real
code behind it (see ``tests/test_injectors.py``) — so the seven cards with no
injector yet were returned to ``mapped``. The number went down because the
definition got stricter, and it goes back up as Day 3 lands the F1 and F5
agentic injectors.
