"""Generate the submission ``.docx`` from RESULTS.md. Never by hand.

Run: ``python scripts/build_docx.py``  (``make docx``)

CLAUDE.md §7 lists the ``.docx`` under **never cut, at any cost** — no document,
no score, regardless of code. This script is how that document stays true.

The rule
---------
**Every number in the document is pulled programmatically from RESULTS.md.**
Not one is typed here. That is the difference between a submission that can be
regenerated on the last night after a retrain and one that has to be re-read
line by line to find the three figures that moved. Day 8 runs this again and
gets a correct document; it does not retype anything.

Prose *is* written here, because prose is argument and argument is a human's job.
But every prose paragraph that mentions a figure interpolates it from the parsed
document, so a sentence cannot drift away from the table above it. Where a number
is unavailable — the fidelity scorecard is Day 7 — the section says so in the
document rather than quietly omitting it.

The four headings
-------------------
The brief words them exactly, and they are reproduced exactly, in order:

1. The novel attacks identified
2. How the system generates and simulates them
3. The detection and mitigation model with efficacy results
4. Real-world feasibility

Nothing is renamed to something that reads better. A judge scoring against a
rubric is looking for those four strings.
